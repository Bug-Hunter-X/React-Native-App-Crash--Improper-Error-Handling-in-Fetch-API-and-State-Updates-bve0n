This React Native code uses a deprecated method for handling network requests. The `fetch` API is used without proper error handling, and the `response.json()` method is not handled asynchronously, leading to potential crashes and unexpected behavior.  Additionally, the state update is done incorrectly, potentially leading to stale closures.
