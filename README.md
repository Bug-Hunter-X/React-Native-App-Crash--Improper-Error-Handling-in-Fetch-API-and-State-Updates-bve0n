This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: improper error handling in network requests using the `fetch` API and incorrect state updates. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code with proper async/await handling, error checking, and state management. This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and proper asynchronous operation when building React Native applications.
